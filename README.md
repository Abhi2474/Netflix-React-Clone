# Netflix-React-Clone

I created a Netflix-React-Clone app using ReactJs and it also has the authentication with the Firebase. This web app is the replica of Netflix app. In this web app the user can register, login and also can logout. It has features that a user can save the favourite movie as well as remove from the saved lists also.
